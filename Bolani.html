<p> Bolani â€“ It is a stuffed vegetarian flat bread. It is also known as Perakai, this Afghan bread is prepared either by baking or frying and has a vegetable stuffing made of different types of ingredients like potatoes, pumpkin, chives, lentils, and leeks.

What does it taste like: The thin crust is easy to chew, and the herbed veg stuffing, especially when enjoyed with other main-course dishes, is bound to steal your heart.</p>
