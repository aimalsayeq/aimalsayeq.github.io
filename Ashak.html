<p> It is a traditional Dumpling Dish from Kabul. It is also called Aushak, it is common menue for holidays. This dish is made of pasta dumplings stuffed with scallion. It is usually served with a meaty tomato sauce. The meal is often enjoyed with yogurt and dry mint garnishes. However, a vegetarian variety is also available.

What does it taste like: The dish is quite spicy, primarily because of the addition of the tomato sauce. The flavors of yogurt and mint further add to its taste.</p>
