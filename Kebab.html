<p>Afghan Lamb Kebab â€“ A Slow-cooked Mutton Dish. As the name suggests, this is a typical Afghan kebab made from meat that is marinated for a specified period, and then barbecued or roasted in an open fire on skewers. It is traditionally made from sheep meat. However, variations of chicken and other meats are also available.

What does it taste like: The slow cooking process gives it an exceptionally gratifying taste, and the meat becomes so tender post-preparation that it will melt in your mouth. It is best eaten with the Afghani green sauce.</p>
